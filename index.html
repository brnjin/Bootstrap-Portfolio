					    Hello! Welcome to my world where I can create and change any element on this website! I was born in Seoul, South Korea until my family made a big move to America when I was 8 years old. I haven't been able to visit Korea since I moved to here because there was a law that mandated all males to go to the army for two years. I became an American citizen recently, which made me renouce my Korean citizenship making it so I can visit without being bragged into the army.

					    I graduated from University of North Carolina at Greensboro back in 2014 and became a licensed Recreational Therapist. I worked in this field just for a few years but started to realized this may not be the line of work I want to work in. A couple of my friends are programmers and suggested that I give it a try. Now I attend University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp because I realized that I love programming. Especially the aspect of problem solving, being creative, and it never gets old since technology is ever changing and improving.
